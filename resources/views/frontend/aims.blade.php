                        <h2>Aims and Objectives</h2>

                        <p>As we have seen, the main objective of Jamia Uloom New York could be summarized into three
                            categories. They are: education, social service and preaching.</p>
                        <p>In addition to the abovementioned programs we will be gradually proceeding for higher classes
                            to teach the students up to the highest level. Such as takhssus fil fiqh, tafseer and hadith
                            (spelization in jurisprudence, Quranic interpretation and Hadith). It will be divided into
                            primary, secondary and higher studies. We will ensure that students who want to pursue their
                            higher studies in the US universities will be able to do that after completing the secondary
                            level here. Thus, we will try to turn them into a productive force of the society who will
                            be playing vital roles in the development of their own communities. Henceforth, technical
                            and vocational education and training will be given to them as well. Several books have been
                            translated into English to further facilitate the education service. We have all the good
                            intention to introduce an e-library to facilitate good reading and understanding of Islam at
                            an ease.</p>
                        <p>We have already initiated projects to help those affected by the Corona pandemic. We are also
                            aiming at helping the community in their adverse situations.</p>
