                            <p>Islam desires that the nikah be announced in public so people are aware it. One method of
                                informing people of the nikah and also to share the happiness brought by the union of
                                the husband and wife is by conducting the nikah in the masjid. Masjid Al-Hamdulillah
                                Foundation provides nikah services for Muslims according to Islamic teachings of
                                marriage principles.</p>

                            <p>Note 2 : Upon receipt of the completed marriage license by the Count Clerk's office, they
                                will retain the official marriage certificate for their records. If you would like a
                                copy of your marriage certificate, you must contact the County Clerk directly and
                                request one. (This request form is usually provided along with the marriage license).

                        </div>
                        <p>No photography or video of any type is allowed in the Masjid. No food or sweets is to be
                            distributed inside the prayer hall. Boxed sweets can be given on the way out. The sister's
                            section is completely separate. Women will only be able to hear the nikah proceedings but
                            will not be able to see it. The sister's entrance is facing the main road (North Ave). The
                            brother's entrance is on the opposite side away from North Ave. We recommend that the nikah
                            be booked a minimum of four weeks prior to the planned date. The nikah is performed in the
                            main prayer hall. The prospective couple may obtain a marriage license from their county
                            office. Masjid Al-Hamdulillah Foundation will keep a copy of the official marriage license
                            for its records. We require the presence of two Muslim male witnesses for the groom and a
                            guardian (wali) for the bride. The brideâ€™s father is considered to be a guardian (wali) of
                            the bride by default. In the absence of the father, the representative scholar from Masjid
                            Al-Hamdulillah performing the nikah will guide the future couple to possible alternatives
                            depending on circumstances. With consultation and approval of the bride, the groom will
                            offer, in writing, the dowry (mahr) to the bride. The amount of the dowry will be recorded
                            on the marriage certificate. The details of the nikah will be recorded on a document which
                            will be signed by the bride, groom, guardian (wali), and the witnesses. Masjid
                            Al-Hamdulillah Foundation will produce a marriage certificate, providing a copy to the bride
                            and groom. Masjid Al-Hamdulillah Foundation will keep a copy of the marriage certificate for
                            its records. The official marriage license will be signed by the representative Masjid
                            Al-Hamdulillah scholar performing the nikah. The Masjid Al-Hamdulillah representative will
                            mail the original license to Dupage County for the registration of the marriage. Masjid
                            Al-Hamdulillah Foundation reserves the right to refuse the performance of a nikah without
                            reason. However, the possibility of this occurring is very low, especially if the above
                            rules are adhered to and proper protocol is followed.</p>
