                        <p>قالَ رَسُولُ اللهِ (صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيهِ وَآلِهِ وَسَلّمَ): ما بُنِيَ بِناءَ فِي الإِسْلامِ أَحَبُّ إِلى اللهِ عَزَّ وَجَلّ مِنَ التَّزْوِيجِ.
                            The Messenger of Allah ﷺ has said, "There is no foundation that has been built in Islam more loved by Allah, (The Greatest and Noblest) than marriage."
                            This hadith shows us the great importance that Allah (SwT) and His Messenger ﷺ have placed on marriage, such that it is the most loved foundation or establishment upon which the Muslim man and woman can build their life upon. If such a foundation is built with love, honesty, sincerity and true faith in Allah (SwT) and all that He has commanded, then there is nothing that could destroy such a firm building.
                            It is a Sunnah of Rasul ﷺ that a marriage ceremony be conducted in a Masjid. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ, said, “Announce this marriage publicly, conduct it in the mosque, and strike the drums for it.” We conduct the marriage ceremony in accordance to Qu’ran and Sunnah.
                            The Wedding Ceremony (Nikaah)
                            Components
                            1 – Consent: ‘Aishah(R) asked Prophet Muhammadﷺ if women must be asked for their permission of marriage. Prophet Muhammadﷺ replied, “Yes.” She said, ‘The virgin is asked for her permission but she gets shy. Prophet Muhammadﷺ said, “Her silence is her permission.” (Bukhari and Muslim)
                            2 – The Wallee (Woman’s Guardian): Prophet Muhammadﷺ said, “There is no nikaah except with a wallee.” (Ahmad, Abu Dawood, Tirmidhi)
                            3 – Two Witnesses: Prophet Muhammadﷺ said, “There is no marriage except with a wallee and trustworthy witnesses.” (Sahih- Bayhaqee) Also, “There is no marriage except with a wallee and two witnesses.” (Sahih Al-Jaami’)
                            4 – The Mahr (Dowry): Allah says (what means): “And give to the women their dowry with a good heart, but if they out of their own good pleasure remit any part of it to you, take it and enjoy it without fear of any harm. ” (Al-Nisa4:4) The mahr can be of any amount, Prophet Muhammadﷺ said, “Look for one even if it was an iron ring.” (Bukhari and Muslim)
                            The woman is not obliged to give the man anything at the time of the wedding, as is done in some cultures.
                            Acts to be Avoided
                            We should be careful to not act as the disbelievers do regarding their mixing of men and women, wearing tuxedos and white wedding gowns, exchanging rings, kissing in public, etc. Prophet Muhammadﷺ said, “Whoever resembles a people is one of them.” (Abu Dawood)
